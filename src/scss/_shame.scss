// The rules

// Obviously you need some kind of rules and criteria:

// If it’s a hack, it goes in shame.css.
// Document all hacks fully:
// What part of the codebase does it relate to?
// Why was this needed?
// How does this fix it?
// How might you fix it properly, given more time?
// Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it then their reasons are probably (hopefully) valid.
// Try and clean shame.css up when you have some down time.
// Even better, get a tech-debt story in which you can dedicate actual sprint time to it.

// Example

// /**
//  * Nav specificity fix.
//  *
//  * Someone used an ID in the header code (`#header a {}`) which trumps the
//  * nav selectors (`.site-nav a {}`). Use !important to override it until I
//  * have time to refactor the header stuff.
//  */
// .site-nav a {
//     color: #BADA55 !important;
// }
//
