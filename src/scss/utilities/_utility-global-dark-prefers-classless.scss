// The usage of @import here, although deprecated in favor of @use and @forward in modern Sass, is justified because it allows conditional inclusion of the dark mode utility styles only when the user's system prefers a dark color scheme. This pattern ensures that the additional styles are loaded contextually, optimizing the CSS output for different user preferences.

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  @import "utilities/utility-global-dark-classless";
}
